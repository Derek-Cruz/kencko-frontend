To run the app you'll have to install these for it to run good! 

First i installed next.

`npx create-next-app@latest`

Then i added everything that helped me out.

`npm install redux react-redux @reduxjs/toolkit @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core @fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons @fortawesome/react-fontawesome`

Then.

`npm run dev` 

I decided to use RTK because i was having a hard time managing the `state` and it really helped me out.
